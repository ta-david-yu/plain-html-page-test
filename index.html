      <p>
        I make games. I make tools to make games. I build engines for fun.
        Sometimes, I also do art.<br />
        Currently, I work as a tools programmer and Unity developer at
        Lucas-Nülle GmbH.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I program in C++, Odin, C#, and TypeScript.<br />
        I'm familiar with a lot of game development tech — Unity, SDL, raylib, OpenGL, to name a few.<br />
        At my current job, I also work with plenty of web tech, but honestly, don't really like them (I actually hate them).<br />
        That's why I use Dear ImGui together with BabylonJS for our company's internal web-based 3D editor tool.<br />
        It's also why this website is written purely in HTML and CSS — I don't want to deal with web frameworks, bundlers, and all that yadayada.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are some of the games, tools, and artworks I worked on.

            <h3>Minds Beneath Us</h3>
            <p>
              Minds Beneath Us is an emotional sci-fi narrative game with an incredible cyberpunk story full of tough dilemmas (not biased at all, just check the reviews LOL).  
              I've been a long-time friend of the team and joined development last year as a "firefighter" to help fix bugs and optimize the game for release.  
              The game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1610440/Minds_Beneath_Us/">Steam</a>.

            <h3>Capsule Heroes</h3>
            <p>
              Capsule Heroes is a 3v3 PvP brawler with a deep combat system and fighting-game-style strategy.  
              I worked as a generalist programmer shortly after graduating from Cologne Game Lab, helping implement prototype features over 3 months.  
              Sadly the game never officially released after alpha testing, but here's the <a href="https://youtu.be/1d06bHl2V2I">trailer</a> and the <a href="https://www.capsuleheroes.com/">website</a>.

            <h3>Shadowrun Trilogy Console Edition</h3>
            <p>
              I worked on this project during my internship at Codeglue (now Behaviour Rotterdam) from 2021 to 2022.  
              It was my first time working on a large, legacy codebase, and the experience really improved my skills in debugging and using related tools.
              I think I resolved 250+ bugs during that time. Here is the <a href="https://youtu.be/IinkPsj5taA">trailer</a> released by the publisher.

            <h3>Gerritory</h3>
            <p>
              Gerritory is a 4-player action party game with unique rules and minimalist visuals.  
              You and your friends control cube characters across various levels, coloring tiles to score points.  
              It was the first commercial game I worked on with a few friends from university, and I even ported it to Nintendo Switch myself.  
              The game is available on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/gerritory-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>  
              and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1175720/Gerritory/">Steam</a>.

            <h3>DYEngine (Custom Game Engine)</h3>
            <p>
              DYEngine is a 2D hobby game engine written in C++. 
              I originally created it for fun and later, in late 2022, 
              used it as the base technology for my bachelor thesis, which focuses on the game object model and ECS.  
              You can check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/ta-david-yu/DYEngine">GitHub</a>, 
              where there are also gameplay videos of games made with the engine.

            <h3>Out of the Mist</h3>
            <p>
              Out of The Mist is a unique game where you need to control the environment,
              and not your character, to complete challenging platforming levels. 
              Explore a world torn apart by a failed experiment with inter-dimensional crystals and learn more about the civilizations that once thrived. 
              The game is free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1886930/Out_of_the_Mist/">Steam</a>.
